### Week 10
1) Why are you interested in your data?
2) Finish [the bootstrap](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/05-cv_boot.pdf)

### Week 11
1) Discuss Thesis statements in class.

###  Week 13 
1) Continue clustering, pca, and factor rotations.

Thursday: Class Presentations!


###  Week 14 
Class presentations!





# Class before the shutdown:

### Week 8 
1) exam prep and exam.

### Week 7  
1) [logistic regression](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/04-classification.pdf).
2) Blow your mind:  "average prediction error" or expected MSE on a test set is a property of a statistical model and estimation procedure.  As such, we can use monte carlo to estimate it!  How?
3)  [Cross Validation](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/05-cv_boot.pdf)
4) Exam next week, Thursday!


### Week 6  
1) [linear regression](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/03-linear_regression.pdf).
2) [logistic regression](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/04-classification.pdf).


#### Homework
Due Tuesday March 3:     
-  Chapter 3 in ISLR: Questions 1, 3, 4, and 15 (p120).   
-  Chapter 4 in ISLR, Question 6 (p170).

Start thinking about the data that you want to use for your project!  the standard project will combine two different sources of data... imagine getting $x$ from one and $y$ from another.  You will want to explore the relationship between $x$ and $y$ and to do so, you will want to control for multiple other variables via multiple linear (or logistic) regression.  You can find these other $x$'s from another source.  However, your project should place a primary emphasis on one of those $x$'s.  

### Week 5  
1) Bias variance tradeoff. [Chapter 2 in ISLR](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/02-statistical_learning.pdf)
2) [play with this simulation](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/lr333/sampleAndFit.R)
3) [linear regression](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/03-linear_regression.pdf)


### Week 4  

1)  [Prediction!](text/worldDataModels.html)  
2)  Start [Chapter 2 in ISLR](http://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~karlrohe/ht/02-statistical_learning.pdf)
3)  Homework 4:  ISLR (p52) 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.10.


### Week 3

### Week 2   
#### Topics 
1) Testing in [World, Data, Models](text/worldDataModels.html)
2) Turn in [homework 1](text/01-GenerateRandomVariables.html) on canvas.  

#### homework
[Homework 2](text/homework/02-TestAndEstimate.html) in html. Or, [homework2](text/homework/02-TestAndEstimate.Rmd) in Rmd.



### Week 1  
#### Topics 
1) This is a fun and important course because...      
- This is not an intro course.  This course serves as a gateway to the advanced courses.  
- This is not a math course.  This is a statistics course.  More specifically, it is an applied statistics course. 
- Why should we study statistics?
2) [Go over syllabus](syllabus.pdf)
3) Introductions to course aims and texts. [World, Data, Models](text/worldDataModels.html)


#### Lecture discussion questions
-  What are your goals after graduation?
-  Where do you envision yourself in 10 years?
-  What are your experiences with R?
-  What type of data are you interested in studying? Topic of data source? Structure of data?

1) What is your major?  
1) What statistics classes have you taken?
1) Why are you in this class?
3) What type of questions are you interested in studying?  Topics? Data sources?  Data types?  Data sources?  


#### Homework 

- [homework1](01-GenerateRandomVariables.html)
-  Form groups of three. Within your group, you should have similar interests (i.e. project topics). Talk to your friends or look for group members in discussion section. Next Thursday, sit with your group. On Thursday, if you have not found a group, that is totally fine! We will have a *free agent* session in class.
- Next week, we will have a reading quiz on [this article](https://hbr.org/2016/10/noise).  As you are reading, consider how this article might be related to our course.
