## Comparing Bouncing Balls to odd birthdays

The Odd Birthday example and the Bouncing Ball Experiment are very different in the way that they think of the world.  In the experiment, you were "randomly" assigned to a treatment group.  As such, *correlation implies causation*.  This is not something that is "in the data".  This is something that is "in the world" and "in our model".
