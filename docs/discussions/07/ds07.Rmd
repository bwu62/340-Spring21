## Discuss together (≤ 5 min)

As an entire section, discuss these together:

1. Are your estimates of the parameters of a model random or fixed? Why?
2. What does it mean to find a confidence interval for an estimate? Explain in the context of conducting the same experiment many times.

<br/>



## Exercise

Today's exercise is intended to be a gentle introduction/review of estimation. We will be using _**real data**_ from the [US Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes) to build a model to **estimate the frequency of earthquakes** in the US.

As usual, break off into **groups of 3-4 students**. In your group, nominate one person to share their screen.



### Background

In seismology (the study of earthquakes), the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes (in a certain place and period of time) can be modeled by the [Gutenberg-Richter law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law) (GR law). Let $M$ be the [Richter magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale) of a seismic event, and $N$ be the number of events with magnitude _**greater than or equal to $M$**_. Then, the GR law states that $$N=10^{a-bM}$$ or in other words $$\log_{10}(N)=a-bM$$ where $a$ and $b$ are unknown constants. Note that this relationship should appear as a line on a plot of $\log_{10}(N)$ vs $M$.

### Data import

Much of the data cleaning and preprocessing has already been done for you.
